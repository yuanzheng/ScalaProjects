  /**
    * Exercise 3
    *
    * The number of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins equals
    *   1. the number of ways to change amount a using all but the first kind of coin, plus
    *   2. the number of ways to change amount a - d using all n kinds of coins, where d is the denomination of the first kind of coin.
    *
    * Note:
    * To make change can be divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of coin,
    * and those that do. Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is equal to the number of
    * ways to make change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make
    * change assuming that we do use the first kind of coin. But the latter number is equal to the number of ways to
    * make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first kind.
    *
    * Define the degenerative cases â€“ ie the points at which the recursion stops. These are:
    * If the money is 0 then there is 1 way to do it;
    * If the money is less than 0 then there are 0 ways to change it;
    * If there are 0 coins then there are 0 ways to offer the change.
